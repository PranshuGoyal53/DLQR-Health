# üß™ Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) ‚Äî Text + Biomarker Fusion

## üìñ Overview
This repository implements a **non-LLM Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) framework** for clinical decision support.  
The system fuses:

- **Semantic retrieval** over *unstructured clinical narratives* using [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) with a [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/) inner-product index.  
- **Biomarker profile matching** over *structured laboratory features* via a **Bayesian Cluster Model (BCM)** that leverages K-Means prototypes and Gaussian likelihoods.  

Together, these modules enable retrieval of similar past patient cases, providing explainable, prototype-based rationale that integrates **textual** and **numeric** evidence.  

The pipeline supports:
- **Training** new models on structured + unstructured datasets  
- **Persistence & reload** of all artifacts  
- **Benchmarking** across configurations (*Text-only, Biomarker-only, Unified*) with Top-1 accuracy and latency metrics  
- **Standalone API-style retrieval** for new patient cases  

If no dataset is found on disk, a synthetic dataset will be generated automatically, enabling end-to-end execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cbr-text-biomarker-fusion.git
cd cbr-text-biomarker-fusion

2. Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, run the environment setup cell in the notebook, which installs both pip and conda packages.

‚∏ª

üöÄ Usage

Run the notebook

Open JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and run:

jupyter lab

Then execute all cells in:
notebooks/cbr_text_biomarker.ipynb

Workflow
	1.	Dependencies are installed and environment is configured.
	2.	Dataset is loaded (or generated synthetically if missing).
	3.	Training builds both the BCM (structured features) and TextCBR (narratives).
	4.	Artifacts are saved under ./results/ for reuse.
	5.	Benchmarking evaluates multiple configurations:
	‚Ä¢	Text-only
	‚Ä¢	BCM-only
	‚Ä¢	Unified (Text + Biomarker fusion)
	6.	Retrieval demo shows how to query the system with a new patient case.

üìä Benchmarking & Evaluation

The system reports:
	‚Ä¢	Top-1 Accuracy (% of test cases where the top retrieved case matches the true diagnosis)
	‚Ä¢	Average Latency (ms per retrieval)

Visual diagnostic plots include:
	‚Ä¢	Class balance distribution
	‚Ä¢	PCA projection of biomarker clusters
	‚Ä¢	Retrieval score breakdowns
	‚Ä¢	Rationale heatmaps comparing query vs retrieved cases

‚∏ª

üß© Key Components
	‚Ä¢	BCMModule: Learns Bayesian Cluster Model over numeric features.
	‚Ä¢	TextCBRModule: Encodes narratives with Sentence-Transformers + FAISS index.
	‚Ä¢	UnifiedCBREngine: Orchestrates text-first retrieval with biomarker re-ranking.
	‚Ä¢	Benchmarking utilities: Evaluate accuracy/latency across configurations.
	‚Ä¢	Retrieval API: Simple function retrieve_cases(new_case) for inference.

üî¨ Research Notes
	‚Ä¢	This system is implemented as a baseline for hybrid retrieval and diagnostic support.
	‚Ä¢	It deliberately avoids using LLMs for reasoning, focusing on transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency.
	‚Ä¢	Can serve as a modular building block in larger Dynamic LLM Query Router (DLQR) pipelines for healthcare.
